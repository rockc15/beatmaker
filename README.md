### Project Paragraph
When we finish the project we plan to have a website where the user can upload or select a set of sounds and create their own musical beat. Once the user is satisfied with their beat, they can save their musical creation to an audio file for future reference. 
 
### How we will use an implement
Have a selection of audio “snippets” of various instruments/beats that can be selected and placed on a grid. The grid serves as the “score” of the song/beat. Putting multiple snippets in various orders would be the primary way of creating the song. From a technical perspective this would be handled by essentially having an array/collection of all the audio snippets and playing them in the order they are arranged on the grid. Ultimately this puts a lot of the work on the UI side of things and avoids a ton of backend code.
